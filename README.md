# Pomodoro_clock
This project is a Pomodoro Clock implemented in Python, designed to help improve productivity through time management. It follows the classic Pomodoro Technique â€” 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. After four work sessions, it includes a longer break to help refresh the mind.
